> Indoor Environment Quality sensing & Pomodoro Technique



## Background

With the blend work model prevailing, office workers spend most of their time inside the buildings as they did before–– but now stay in their homes more than offices. It is proved that indoor environmental quality has a significant influence on staffs’ productivity, health and wellbeing (U.S. Green Building Council, 2014). Unlike commercial buildings, most of the residential buildings have a lack of large-scale IT infrastructure and building-wise environmental controls which makes it hard to deploy state-of-the-art sensors in the building (Graham Coulby et al., 2020).

However, this problem provides a great opportunity to develop a lightweight and portable indoor environmental sensor for people who adopt a flexible working model. DeskElf is born for this need and manages to offer a desktop device helping workers keep productive and healthy at the same time. Besides, DeskElf can serve as an extended service of corporates’ wellbeing programmes, taking care of employees’ working environment just like what they do at the office.
